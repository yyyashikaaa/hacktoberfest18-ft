## What is Hacktoberfest'18?

Hacktoberfest is a global event which motivates open source contributors to boost up their contribution. As well as it is a month-long celebration of open source software in partnership with GitHub. In addition to that by contributing to this challenge you can earn a limited edition T-Shirt.

## First Contributions
